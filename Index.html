		<h2>About Me</h2>
			<p>
                My name is Cris. I lived in Koronadal City, South Cotabato but originally from General Santos City.
                I am a hard-working and driven individual who isn't afraid to face a challenge. I'm passionate about my work and I know how to get the job done. I would describe myself as an open and honest person who doesn't believe in misleading other people and tries to be fair in everything I do.
                I like to study new things. Being knowledgeable about (your field) or any subject is an ongoing process, and Im always proactive about seeking new opportunities to develop and grow in my role. Those opportunities could be in the form of training, a conference, listening to a speaker, or taking on a new project, but the motivation is to increase my knowledge of the field.
                Some of my favorite things to do are listen to music.
            </p>
